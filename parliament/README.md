# Moloch Parliament

Moloch Parliament is an [Vue.js][vue] web app to view multiple Moloch clusters.

This project was generated with [Vue CLI][vuecli].


## Running from RPM/DEB
If using prepackaged version of Moloch, use "Configure --parliament" to setup.  It will use port 8008 by default.

It is meant to sit behind a reverse proxy such as apache, with config like the following added.
```
ProxyPassMatch   ^/$ http://localhost:8008/parliament retry=0
ProxyPass        /parliament/ http://localhost:8008/parliament/ retry=0
```


### Install Dependencies

The app uses dependencies that are all bundled and minified using [webpack][webpack] via `npm run build`. This compiles the application into an output directory, in this case `parliament/vueapp/dist`. This is done automatically when starting the application with `npm start`.

The app uses a number of node.js tools for initialization. You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/][node].

* We get dependencies via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].

In the app directory, execute:

```
npm install
```

You should find that you have a new folder:

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the dependencies


### Run the Application

#### Production

To start the app for production, simply run:
```
npm start -s -- --pass somepassword --port 8765 -c ./absolute/path/to/parliament.json --key ./absolute/path/to/keyFile.pem --cert ./absolute/path/to/certFile.pem
```
This command starts the app, passing in the password, port, config file location, and key and cert file locations. It also bundles the application files into the `parliament/vueapp/dist` folder.

_**Important**: when using `npm start` the leading `--`, before the parameters is essential._

You can also run the app by building then starting the app. Like so:
```
npm run build
```
```
node server.js --pass somepassword --port 8765 -c ./absolute/path/to/parliament.json --key ./absolute/path/to/keyFile.pem --cert ./absolute/path/to/certFile.pem
```

**The parameters are defined as follows:**

| Parameter    | Default | Description |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| --pass       | EMPTY   | Password will be used to login to update the parliament. If it is not set, the app runs in read only mode. **IMPORTANT:** passing in a password will overwrite any password already configured in your parliament. You can always configure a password later in the UI. |
| --port       | 8008    | Port for the web app to listen on. |
| -c, --config | ./parliament.json | Absolute path to the JSON file to store your parliament information. |
| --key        | EMPTY   | Private certificate to use for https, if not set then http will be used. **certfile** must also be set. |
| --cert       | EMPTY   | Public certificate to use for https, if not set then http will be used. **keyFile** must also be set. |

_Note: if you do not pass in the port or file arguments, the defaults are used._

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8765`, or whichever port you passed into the `npm start` command.

To login, use the password that you passed into the `npm start` command. If you did not supply a password, you can view the parliament in read only mode or configure one by navigating to the settings page.

#### Development

To start the app for development and testing, simply run:
```
npm run dev
```

This command starts the app with the necessary config options set (`--pass admin --port 8008 -c ./parliament.dev.json`) and bundles the unminified application files into into the `parliament/vueapp/dist` folder.

`npm run dev` uses webpack to package the files then watches for changes to relevant files, and re-bundles the app after each save.

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8008`.

To login, use the password, 'admin'.

### Parliament Definition
`parliament.json` (or whatever you pass into the -c config option when starting Parliament) is the file that describes your parliament. You can create this by hand or use the Parliament UI to create, edit, and delete groups and clusters. View the supplied `parliament.example.json` to view an example parliament configuration.

### Issues
`parliament.issues.json` will be created to store issues pertaining to the clusters in your parliament.

##### Parliament model:
```javascript
{                   // parliament object
  version: x,       // version (number)
  password: 'hash', // hashed password
  groups: [ ... ],  // list of groups in the parliament
  settings: {       // parliament settings
    general: {      // general settings

      // capture nodes need to check in at least this often (number of seconds)
      // if a capture node has not checked in, an Out Of Date issue will be added to the node's cluster
      outOfDate: 30,

      // Elasticsearch query timeout (number of seconds)
      // Aborts the queries and adds an ES Down issue if no response is received
      esQueryTimeout: 5,

      // Remove all issues after (number of minutes)
      // Removes issues that have not been seen again after the specified time
      removeIssuesAfter: 60,

      // Remove acknowledged issues after (number of minutes)

        // which issues to alert on via this notifier (object)
